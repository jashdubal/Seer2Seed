# Seer2Seed
An interface that interprets what a user wants to watch, crawls to find the best torrent, seeds it and streams it back to the user.
- make it a web application? (is this the most universal?)

Connection points:
- LG TV
- mobile
- web browser


MVP:
- cli that can be prompted with a movie (e.g. "Batman Begins")?
- backend that can intelligently retrieve the best torrent for that movie?
- backend that can seed the torrent and provide the file as a download?
